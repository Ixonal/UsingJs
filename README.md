UsingJs
=======

Javascript async dependency loader. Think of this as a sort of consolidation of existing script loaders, with built in dependency tracking

For now, here are the usages:

on your page, include using.js
<script type="text/javascrpt" src="location/of/using.js" data-script-root="/script/root" data-using="main"></script>
